# garen
To teach people that already have a basic knowledge of League of Legends how to play Garen.
Home (to direct people to the other pages), Runes (to teach them what runes to take), Abilities (to teach them what Garen's abilities do), Items (to teach them what items to build), Contact Me (to give them a way to give me feedback), Credits (to give credit for work that isn't mine), Pac-Man (it's SUPPOSED to have a game of pac-man...)
Features: Youtube Video, easy to navigate design :)
Design decisions I made include how I should display my information (I went with tables), and what colors the page should be, mainly.
Well I'm still struggling to get the pac-man game onto the page. Past that, I struggled with not a whole lot. Building this website went a lot smoother than I expected.
I learned how images interact within tables, as well as how to embed a youtube video. Past that, I learned how different forms interact with each other on a website.
